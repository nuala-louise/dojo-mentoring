Coding can help learners to participate in and shape a rapidly changing world. However, learning materials often reflect the historic stereotype that computing is a subject and career for White men. This includes how topics are presented, as well as the language and media assets chosen to introduce them.

Promotional materials for your Dojo, learning materials and mentoring approaches should promote equity and ensure that learners can see themselves represented through computing.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Culturally relevant pedagogy** emphasises the importance of including and valuing all learners’ knowledge, ways of learning, and heritage.</p>

It promotes the development of learners’ critical consciousness of the world and encourages them to ask questions about ethics, power, privilege, and social justice. Culturally relevant pedagogy emphasises opportunities to address issues that are important to learners and their communities.

## Accessibility practices for Dojos
At your Dojo, you will have lots of different participants, including participants with disabilities and/or additional needs. You can help make a Dojo more accessible through listening to your participants, making reasonable adjustments, and deciding what works best, so that they can have the best possible CoderDojo experience.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0">Everyone’s needs and abilities will be different, and this goes for all members of your Dojo — not just those with a disability.</p>

--- task ---
Keep channels of communication open. Actively listen to members of your Dojo, and discuss together how you can best support their participation.
