Coding can help learners to participate in and shape a rapidly changing world. It's important that learning materials present computing as a career that is open to all and avoid historic stereotypes related to computing. This includes how topics are presented, as well as the language and media assets chosen to introduce them. 
  
Our learning materials are designed to be inclusive. Care should be taken when using other materials.

Promotional materials for your Dojo, learning materials and mentoring approaches should promote equity and ensure that learners can see themselves represented through computing.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Equity** refers to fair and just practices and policies that ensure all people thrive. Equality implies treating everyone as if their experiences are exactly the same. While equitable means acknowledging and addressing inequalities that advantage some and disadvantage others.</p>

Culturally relevant pedagogy promotes the development of learners’ critical consciousness of the world and encourages them to ask questions about ethics, power, privilege, and social justice. Culturally relevant pedagogy emphasises opportunities to address issues that are important to learners and their communities.

  
### Culturally responsive mentoring practices include:
+ Drawing on learners’ cultural knowledge and experiences to inform their learning 
+ Providing opportunities for learners to choose personally meaningful projects and to express their own cultural identities 
+ Exploring issues of social justice and bias
+ Using equitable guidance approaches, such as open-ended, inquiry-led activities and discussion-based collaborative tasks.
+ Providing inclusive representations of a range of cultures, and making sure learning materials are accessible

## Accessibility practices for Dojos
At your Dojo, you will have lots of different participants, including participants with disabilities and/or additional needs. You can help make a Dojo more accessible through listening to your participants, making reasonable adjustments, and deciding what works best, so that they can have the best possible CoderDojo experience.
