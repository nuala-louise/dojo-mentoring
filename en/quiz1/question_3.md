legend: Question 3 of 3
---

A young child who is new to the Dojo says *"I can’t think of a project idea."* How do you respond?

--- choices ---

- ( ) I'll give you an idea!


  --- feedback ---
Avoid giving a Ninja your own ideas. It might not be something they are interested in or relavant to their experiences. Encourage them to think for themselves using prompting questions.

- ( ) Lets do a quick brainstorm with a pen and paper and see what we come up with.


  --- feedback ---
It’s important to encourage Ninja's own ideas, but you may need to act as a catalyst to help draw those ideas out.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) What topics are you interested in, and what kind of things would you like to make? We can look through our projects website and see what you could make.


  --- feedback ---
Ask questions about their interests to help encourage them to come up with their own ideas. Looking at our project examples can help them decide the kind of project they'd like to make.

- ( ) Play a video game until you've thought of something to make.


  --- feedback ---
Avoid encouraging young people to passively play video games in the Dojo. The Dojo is a space for creating. Instead ask the young person questions to draw out what kind of project they could make.
