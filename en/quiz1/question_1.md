If a Ninja is getting frustrated it’s important to support them and re-energise them. Don’t take over the mouse and keyboard as this is likely to discourage them further.

- (x) “This part of the project is challenging. Let’s see if we can work out a solution together”

If a Ninja is getting frustrated it’s important to support them. It's ok to admit that trying something new can be challenging sometimes. Highlight how they are not alone if others have had similar problems, and encourage peer-support by asking the other young person to explain how they resolved it.

- ( )”You can just give up if you don’t understand and try something totally different.”

If a Ninja is getting frustrated it’s important to support them. While you might think that encouraging them to do something different is helpful, it teaches them that they should give up anytime something is challenging and that coding isn't suitable for them. Instead you could support them to resolve the issue or ask them to focus on another area of the project and come back to it later. Sometimes a little break away from a bug can make it easier to spot with fresh eyes.

- ( ) “Get someone else to do it for you.”

  --- feedback ---
If a ninja is struggling it is good to listen and help them for a bit so they feel supported. It's ok to admit that coding can be challenging sometimes. Make suggestions and point to their screen but try to get them to work through the solution, rather than getting someone else to do it for them.
