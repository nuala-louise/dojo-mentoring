legend: Question 2 of 3
---

A teenager asks you during a session *“Can I try something a bit harder? I have got the hang of this now.”* How do you respond?


--- choices ---

- (x) Sure, we can look for some content that builds on this. Is there anything you really want to try to do?

  --- feedback ---
When appropriate, encourage Ninjas to stretch themselves by giving them a new target to reach for. Asking for their suggestions also makes sure that it continues to be relavant to their interests.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) No, perhaps you should perfect this first.

  --- feedback ---
When a young person expresses their interest in something harder, it is good to listen and accomodate their learning journey.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Great, I am working on an open-source database project that I want someone to help me with. You haven't coded in this language yet, but it'd be great for you to help me debug it.

  --- feedback ---
Take the young person's interests and skill level into account when moving on to new content. Avoid asking them to do coding work on your own personal projects.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) That's great, there are a few different things you could add on to this to challenge yourself. Would you also like to share what you've learnt so far with other Ninjas at the end of the session?

  --- feedback ---
When appropriate, encourage Ninjas to stretch themselves by giving them a new target to reach for. This can also include developing their presentation skills by showcasing what they have done so far to others.
