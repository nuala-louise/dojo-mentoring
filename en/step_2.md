With the support of mentors Ninjas develop a wide-range of skills in a Dojo. Young people learn:

---
title: Confidence with technology
---

Young people develop an understanding of technology, in how it works and how they can use it to create games, apps, and websites. This in turn grows their confidence in using it.
  
--- /collapse ---
  
--- collapse ---
---
title: Real world applications
---  

Our project focused approach not only helps them develop their skills and knowledge, but also helps them recognise how these skills are applied in the real world.

---
title: Creativity
---  
Creativity allows for young people's self-fulfilment, personal development and self-expression. Using technology to express themselves creatively offers a novel and relevant way to their experiences.

title: Communication and teamwork
---
Learning how to talk to others with different skills and experiences, learning how to discuss issues they encounter and find solutions, as well as understanding and managing tasks as part of a team.

---
title: Critical thinking
---
Developing young people’s ability to critically assess what they read and develop the skill set to examine bias, and seek out reputable sources and reference for information is a really important skill.

---
title: Empathy
---

Designing, developing and iterating on projects taking the user's experience and perspective into account helps young people think about other people’s needs.

---
title: Resilience
---
Trial and error are necessary and useful parts of coding and debugging. They encourage young people to persevere and develop their own resilience.
  
--- /collapse ---

--- collapse ---

---
title: Presentation skills
---
  
Often young people are encouraged to talk about what they have made at the end of a session. Young people learn how to describe what they have done, present aspects of their project, and answer others questions about their project.

title: Coding concepts and programming skills
---
Even in beginner languages like Scratch, Ninjas will learn about coding concepts such as “sequences” where code instructions must run in the order presented and iteration (loops), where a series of instructions are repeated, such as with the “repeat until” block in [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

## Group management and expectation setting
Dojos aren’t formal education settings. It’s important that sessions are enjoyable and fun for all those involved. A good way to ensure this is to set expectations early. Encourage parents or guardians to read the [code of behaviour](https://help.coderdojo.com/cdkb/s/article/Code-of-Behaviour-volunteers){:target="_blank"} with children before attending. You can highlight the ethos of CoderDojo in your venue with our [motto posters](https://help.coderdojo.com/cdkb/s/article/Dojo-Motto-Posters){:target="_blank"}. 

--- task ---
Involve young people in developing a code of conduct for the Dojo at the start of each term. If young people feel involved in setting the rules they are more likely to follow them.
--- /task ---

It is important for volunteers to take responsibility for promoting good and courteous behaviour themselves during the Dojo too. 

--- task ---
Use praise consistently and fairly ie. avoid favouritism.
  
--- /task ---
  
--- task ---
Involve and motivate young people by discussing and supporting them with projects appropriate to their needs and experience. 

--- /task ---

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
<span style="color: #0faeb0"> Parents or guardians of those under 12 should be present at the Dojo. 
</p>

--- task ---
Talk with the parent or guardian if particularly disruptive behaviour occurs during a session. The child may be frustrated with a project, reacting to an external stressor, or have additional needs that are not being supported.
