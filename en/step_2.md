### What young people learn in a Dojo
  
With the support of mentors Ninjas develop a wide-range of skills in a Dojo. They learn

Confidence with technology
Young people develop an understanding of technology, in how it works and how they can use it to create games, apps, and websites. This in turn grows their confidence in using it.

Real world applications
Our project focused approach not only helps them develop their skills and knowledge, but also helps them recognise how these skills are applied in the real world.

Creativity
Creativity allows for young people's self-fulfilment, personal development and self-expression. Using technology to express themselves creatively offers a novel and relevant way to their experiences.

Communication and teamwork
Learning how to talk to others with different skills and experiences, learning how to discuss issues they encounter and find solutions, as well as understanding and managing tasks as part of a team.

Critical thinking
Developing young people’s ability to critically assess what they read and develop the skill set to examine bias, and seek out reputable sources and reference for information is a really important skill.

Empathy
Designing, developing and iterating on projects taking the user's experience and perspective into account helps young people think about other people’s needs.

Resilience
Trial and error are necessary and useful parts of coding and debugging. They encourage young people to persevere and develop their own resilience.

Presentation skills
Often young people are encouraged to talk about what they have made at the end of a session. Young people learn how to describe what they have done, present aspects of their project, and answer others questions about their project.

Coding concepts and programming skills
Even in beginner languages like Scratch, Ninjas will learn about coding concepts such as “sequences” where code instructions must run in the order presented and iteration (loops), where a series of instructions are repeated, such as with the “repeat until” block”.

As you can see, there are a lot of skills volunteers can help young people learn in a Dojo beyond programming.
