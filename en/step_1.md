## Introduction

CoderDojo is a global movement of free, volunteer-led, community-based programming clubs, called Dojos. Young people aged seven to seventeen can visit a Dojo where they can learn with the support of volunteers to code, build a website, create an app or a game, and explore technology in an informal, creative, and social environment.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Volunteers**</span> are the backbone of CoderDojo. Without them, CoderDojo would not exist!
</p>

This training will primarily focus on supporting volunteers who mentor young learners through providing guidance or technical support.

Once completed you should:
+ Understand the different roles volunteers have in a Dojo
+ Recognise different mentoring styles used at a Dojo
+ Learn a little about the most popular coding languages used in Dojos
+ Know what resources are available to support mentors

## A Dojo in action

Dojos run in a variety of different spaces and contexts. No two Dojos or even two sessions will look the same. Dojo’s are collaborative spaces, where chatter between the Ninjas is encouraged. Some clubs find a bit of structure useful for planning their events. 

Feel free to change it up, and alternate the types of sessions you run based on volunteers experiences and participants interests.

## Roles within a Dojo
Within a Dojo there are usually the children attending (Ninjas), parents of those attending, and those volunteering their time to support.

A Ninja is an attendee of the Dojo, generally between the age of 7 - 17. The only requirements for Ninjas are enthusiasm, an eagerness to learn and a sprinkle of creativity.

title: Champions and Co-champions
---
A Champion or co-champions are people who volunteer to take charge of setting up, running and maintaining a Dojo. Once the Dojo is open, they can be viewed as project managers of a Dojo. They don’t have to be technical but they do have great organisational skills.

title: Mentors (technical or guidance)
---
Mentors support young people who attend Dojos in a variety of ways by facilitating their learning during Dojo sessions.

+ Mentors (Technical) are those with programming skills and/or coding experience. They often have a preferred area and expertise within which they like to work (eg. HTML, Python, Unity). This can influence the topics covered in the Dojo.

However, you don’t have to be a coding expert to be a mentor.

+ Mentors (Guidance) are those who facilitate learning by encouraging young people, helping them get set up, talking them through a project and supporting them to find their own solutions. Often guidance mentors gain an understanding of basic languages like Scratch and be a huge help.

title: Youth Mentors
---
Youth Mentors are usually CoderDojo Ninjas who have attended their Dojo for a while, who have some coding experience and are happy to share their knowledge by mentoring other young people at the Dojo. Youth mentoring helps to develop interpersonal skills such as communication, presentation and confidence. Youth mentoring should be encouraged. They can be fantastic role models to other Ninjas.

title: Support volunteers
---
Volunteers support the Champion and mentors in running a Dojo. They help run the event and generally support both mentors and Ninjas. Volunteers are often enthusiastic parents of Ninjas! Often Volunteers will upskill to Mentors (Guidance) once they feel confident in a topic e.g. Scratch or HTML/CSS..
