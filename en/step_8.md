## Showcasing and reflection

Showcasing projects at the end of a session is a great way to develop young people’s presentation and public speaking skills. 

--- task ---

Ask Ninjas to showcase their project to show that you recognise the efforts they have gone to and that you believe that they have something of value to share with others. 

--- /task ---


--- task ---

Encourage the Ninjas to listen and clap after another Ninja has shared a project. This helps ensure that the presenter has a positive experience.

End of year project showcases or larger showcases like [Coolest Projects](https://online.coolestprojects.org/) can also be very rewarding for mentors, as you get to see how your support has helped Ninjas progress and learn.

<span style="color: #0faeb0">**Coolest Projects** is a creative technology showcase for young people, it includes both in-person events and an online project gallery. Coolest Projects Global is free and open to creators up to the age of 18, wherever they are in the world.</p>

## Reflecting on learnings
Encouraging learners to revisit the important learnings from the project solidifies new knowledge and provides opportunities for mastery. We provide opportunities for this in our [new project paths](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths).


--- task ---

Encourage reflection by asking questions of young people, such as:
+ What does this piece of code do?
+ How did you do that?
+ What would happen if you tried … instead? 
+ What would you do differently if you were starting the project again?
