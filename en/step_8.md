## Showcasing and reflection

Showcasing projects at the end of a session is a great way to develop young people’s presentation and public speaking skills. 

--- task ---

Ask Ninja's to showcase their project to highlight that you recognise the efforts that they have gone to and that you believe that they have something of value to share with others.

--- task ---

Encourage the Ninjas to listen and clap after another Ninja has shared a project. This helps ensure that the presenter has a really positive experience.

## Reflecting on learnings
Encouraging learners to revisit the important learnings from the project solidifies new knowledge and provides opportunities for mastery. We provide opportunities for this in our [new project paths](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/paths).


--- task ---

Encourage reflection by asking questions of young people such as:
+ What does this piece of code do?
+ How did you do that?
+ What would happen if you tried … instead? 
+ What would you do differently if you were starting the project again?
