At a Dojo you will see a mix of different styles of mentoring depending on the situation. Being comfortable as a mentor and striking a balance of mentoring styles is importance.

title: Encouragement
---
Using encouragement and a positive attitude to get children to take pride in learning something they initially found difficult. This positive encouragement approach helps guide young people to new ideas and fresh approaches.

title: Questioning
---
A mentor who has an understanding of the subject can ask thought out leading questions to stimulate the thinking of a Ninja. These questions can lead them to consider new or alternative techniques for solving a problem, as well as verifying their understanding of material
  
For example:
+ It looks like you’re doing the same thing a few times here, is there some way of saving yourself writing it out again? *Suggesting the use of loops*
+ What’s happening in this piece of code?

title: Supporting self-help
---
We use the motto “Ask 3 then me!” to encourage Ninjas to try a range of self-help strategies if they get stuck before going to a mentor. They are told to 
+ Ask yourself (test your code and try to find the error)
+ Ask a search engine
+ Ask your peers

And only then ask a mentor.

title: Hands on
---
A ‘Hands-on’ style is when Mentors recognise that a Ninja is stuck on a problem and may need more direct guidance. Often this approach is useful for younger Ninjas who cannot find the answer elsewhere, or struggle with typing accurately.

title: Lead from the front
---
Leading from the front can be useful to teach concepts and logic or to introduce a topic. We advise Dojos to not rely on this approach often, so that the Dojo does not resemble a school environment.
