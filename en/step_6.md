### Ice-breakers and unplugged activities
Icebreaker activities are designed to welcome and encourage interaction among Ninjas at the start of a Dojo. Offline or unplugged activities are coding-related activities that don’t require a computer. These short games are fantastic ways to help new Ninjas feel relaxed, and can also help young people learn coding concepts and terminology in a fun, informal way.

## Our project resources
Dojos are hardware and software agnostic. That means young people and volunteers can use whatever resources, tools and programming languages that suit their needs. There are lots of freely available resources online, from unplugged activities to hardware emulators to tools to help young people develop computational thinking.


One way we support clubs is by offering learners a catalogue of more than 250 free digital making projects! Some of them have been translated into 30 languages.

### Improved project paths
More recently, we’ve released our educational projects in a new format to better support young people who want to learn coding and gradually develop independence. Each path is made up of six projects, of three different types, in a 3-2-1 structure:
+ The first **three Explore projects** introduce learners to a set of skills and knowledge, and provide step-by-step instructions to help learners develop initial confidence. 
+ The next **two Design projects** are opportunities for learners to practise the skills they learned in the previous Explore projects, and to express themselves creatively. 
+ In the final **one Invent project**, learners focus on completing a project to meet a project brief for a particular audience. The project brief is written so that they can meet it using the skills they’ve learned by following the path up to this point. 

### New project features
We’ve also introduced some new features to add interactivity, choice, and authenticity to each project in a path:

Solidify new knowledge and provide opportunities for mastery by letting learners revisit the important learnings from the project. Common misconceptions are highlighted, and learners are guided to the correct answer.

title: An open-ended upgrade step

At the end of each project offers inspiration for young people to give them ideas for ways in which they could continue to improve upon their project in the future.
