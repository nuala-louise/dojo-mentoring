### Mentor input and involvement in sessions
It is important that your interests and motivations for volunteering are being met, as is feasible. Open communication is key to this. Talking to those involved in managing the club and being involved in the planning Dojo sessions helps ensure that your role is fulfilling, you are performing tasks that are interesting to you and that ideas for adaptations that could be beneficial to volunteers and the wider Dojo are discussed and acted on.
